**Flybirds**
Is a simple and fun 2D game where you control a bird navigating through a series of pipes.
The objective is to pass as many pipes as possible without colliding, while gravity continuously pulls the bird downwards.
**How to Play**
Press the Spacebar to make the bird fly upward.
Avoid hitting the pipes or the ground.
For each pair of pipes the bird passes through, your score increases.
If the bird collides with a pipe or the ground, the game is over.
**Installation & Requirements**
Make sure you have Java installed.
Download or clone the project files.
Run the Flybirds.java file in your preferred IDE or from the command line.
Start playing by pressing the spacebar to fly!
